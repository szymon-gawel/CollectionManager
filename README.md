# CollectionManager
Welcome to my app, that will make it easier to manage your collections! 

Current functionality: </br>
<b>1.</b> User can add an item to 2 <i>default</i> collections, edit it and remove it </br>
<b>2.</b> User can list all of the items of specific collection </br>
</br>
Future functionality: </br>
<b>1.</b> User can create his own collection, not only default </br>
<b>2.</b> User can choose which options he wants to assign to new item </br>
<b>3.</b> A lot of other functions that will be listed soon! </br>
